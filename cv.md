## **Profile**
 Nowadays I'm learning web development particularly with a focus on JavaScript. I have development experience in the past but now i've decided back to programming and web dev. I have developed responsive websites in the past for fun and solved various problems in python I am sure that I will be able to master this profession, as I have such important qualities as: technical mindset, incredible determination, excellent perseverance, —Åraving for new knowledge and self-development. Now I'm studying for two months and a feel that i have really good potential, so I decided to enroll the course from The Rolling Scopes School to speed up learning.
